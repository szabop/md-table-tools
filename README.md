# Function

This is a small plugin to format/manipulate/navigate markdown tables in markdown documents.
This is WIP, I do it for my own purposes, so not everything is implemented so far.

# Prerequsites

Treesitter grammar for markdown has to be enabled.

# Use

Install the plugin, and by default use comman FT to format the markdown table under the cursor.
